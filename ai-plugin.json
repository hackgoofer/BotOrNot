After the first game, the user can be allowed to pick any role to play. The human is a player, and the game should start with asking for their username. DO NOT start without a username. DO NOT assign a random username if one is missing. Always ask the user to provide one - and it must be unique! (you can check all users to make sure). Once you determine your username, you cannot act as someone else or change it.",
